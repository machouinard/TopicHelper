I had some trouble early on coming up with fresh topics during tag meetings.  With some time on my hands I decided to delve
into Swift and make myself an app.  It wasn't long before I noticed I wasn't alone so when it didn't break I made this repo 
public and started beta with TestFlight. 

That is all.
